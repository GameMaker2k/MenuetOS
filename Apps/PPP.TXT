PPP Dialer
==========

by Mike Hibbett and Shrirang Bhagwat

PPP Dialer is a PPP client that connects Menuet to the internet through an
external serial modem.

PPP dialer uses COM port settings from Stack Configuration application.
For Com1: port 0x3F8 and irq 4. Com2: port 0x2f8 and irq 3.

Before using PPP you must configure it for your Internet Service Provider.
Details are shown below.

Once you have configured PPP and re-assembled it, simply run the program and
press DAIL. When the ISP answers the call and the modems establish a
connection ( which can take 30s ), PPP will display 'PPP started'. When
the host has assigned an IP address to menuet you will see
'IP Link established' and the assigned IP address.

You do not have to set up or configure any other parts of the stack system.
Once PPP is established, the stack is fully operational.

To disconnect, click on DISCONNECT. MAke sure your modem hangs up within 10s.
If not, turn the modem off.

See stack.txt for a description of internet applications available under
Menuet.


Configuring PPP
===============

To configure PPP you must change the source code and re-assemble it.

There are three bits of information you need to make the changes

1) The telephone number of your ISP
2) The username that PPP uses when connecting to the ISP
3) The password that PPP uses when connecting to the ISP

The source code for PPP is in PPP.ASM and CHAT.INC.

In file CHAT.INC, change the 'phonenumber' following ATDT to your ISP
telephone number.

In file PPP.ASM line 2172, change the first 'free' string to your ISP's
username. Change the second 'free' string to your ISP's password.
There are three numbers on this line: 14, 4, 4.
The first number, 14, is the length of the bytes that follow + 4
The second number is the length of the username string
The third number is the length of the password string.
Change these numbers if the lengths of the strings you enter are different
to the lengths of the original strings.

Here is an example.

original:   PAPREQStr           db 14, 4, 'free', 4, 'free'
new:        PAPREQStr           db 20, 8, 'username', 6, 'passwd'

When you have made these changes, save them back to the ram disk.
To assemble the changes, run FASM.
Change infile to PPP.ASM
Change outfile to PPP
Click on START COMPILE.

You can now run PPP from FASM or from the menu.


Debugging
=========

By default PPP outputs no debuggin information. If you are interested in
seeing what PPP is doing, there are debugging option in the source file
PPP.ASM that you can change.

These options are

DEBUG_OUTPUT        If set to FALSE, no debugging information is generated
DEBUG_PPP_OUTPUT    If set to TRUE, PPP data exchanges are displayed
DEBUG_PORT2_OUTPUT  If set to TRUE, debugging information will go to com2

The debugging output will go to the DEBUG BOARD for display. Every IP
packet received or transmitted is printed.

This information is actually quite interesting; You can see attempts by
viruses on remote hosts to connect to your machine.


Understanding how to configure PPP for connection to an ISP can be quite
difficult, so feel free to contact one of the authors directly or on
