1) How to load RAM image from hd at boot-time ?
   
At this point you'll still need the floppy.
   
The image is loaded from the root of fat32 partition (win95/98)
located at PRIMARY MASTER's first partition (mostly drive C:)
   
Basicly, all you have to do is to copy the MSETUP.EXE (0.65 pre-5 +)
to root of your win95/98 C: drive and Menuet will load the image
from that file.
