Important!:
the RAMDISK in memory should be the same as the one on the DISKETTE. (boot with option 1, read from floppy)
Don't remove the diskette while it's written to, or when you are about to write to it.

Commands:
[Copy] Write the whole ramdisk to the floppy.
[Update] Write only the changes you made to the floppy.

Settings:
[X] Write directly to floppy: also does an 'update' the next time you save a file.

Reading is 'grayed out' because it's not implemented yet.

The settings are currently not saved. This will change in later versions.
